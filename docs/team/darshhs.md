## Overview

### Summary of Contributions

Here are my contributions to the project

- **New Feature:** Parsing user input into valid instructions
    - **What it does:** Converts raw user input into structured commands
      that the application can process
    - **Justification:** This feature is essential for interpreting user commands
      and ensuring that the application responds correctly to user requests. It ensures
      that inputs are of the correct String type and format before processing.
    - **Highlights:** Implemented robust parsing logic to handle various command
      formats for each command type used in application. A XYZCommand(XYZCommand being addCommand,
      deleteCommand etc.) object is created based on the command type and passed to ClassCraft to 
      execute the command.
  
- **New Feature:** Created storage class to handle saving and loading data
    - **What it does:** Manages the persistence of user data by saving to and loading from files.
    - **Justification:** This feature is crucial for ensuring that user data is retained between sessions,
      allowing users to pick up where they left off.
    - **Highlights:** Implemented methods for appending to and reading from files, ensuring data integrity
      during save and load operations.

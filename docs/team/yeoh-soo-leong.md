## **Project: ClassCraft**

ClassCraft is a module management tool for NUS students. It helps you to organize modules,
track graduation requirements and plan your academic journey efficiently. Using this, you will be
able to plan your semesters effectively, ensuring you meet all necessary requirements for graduation.

### Architecture

![UML diagram of the high-level architecture of ClassCraft with classes](/UMLdiagrams/ArchitectureWithClasses.png)

Above shows the high-level architecture of ClassCraft. The programme is broken down to various packages within the
classcraft folder, each handling a different domain of the programme. This section will provide an overview of each
package and its role and functionality.

**Main components of the architecture**

`ClassCraft.java` (containing only the `ClassCraft` class) is the main entry point into the programme. It handles
startup and is responsible for cleanup after the programme is exited.

The bulk of ClassCraft's functionality is handled by the following components:

+ `command`: Contains all the commands that can be carried out by the user.
+ `data`: Stores data on the modules required for specific CEG specialisations, alongside their prerequisites.
+ `exceptions`: Contains all exception classes.
+ `nusmodsfetcher`: Fetches data from the NUSMods API to get information on modules.
+ `parser`: Decodes the user's input to an appropriate command.
+ `storage`: Responsible for saving the user's study plan.
+ `studyplan`: Handles actions relating to the study plan.
+ `ui`: The UI of the programme, and the only point of interaction with the user.

### Command Component

The `command` package contains all the commands that can be carried out by the user.
Each command is represented by a class that extends the abstract `Command` class.

This is how the 'AddCommand' class interacts with other components:

When a command is executed, it interacts with the `Studyplan`, `UI`, and `Storage` components to perform its function.

### NUSModsFetcher Component

`NUSmodsFetcher.java` is responsible for fetching the endpoints of the NUSMods API, which stores module information as
`.json` files,
in order to obtain information about modules.

`NUSmodsFetcher` first retrieves the `.json` file containing information on a given module from the NUSMods API as a
`JsonNode`.
The various methods then return the respective parts of the the `.json` file as required by the user.

### Parser Component

The `Parser` class, under `Parser` package 
is responsible for parsing user input into commands that can be executed by the application.

When the user inputs a command, a new instance of parser is created, and 
the `Parser` class processes the input string to identify the command type and its
respective arguments. It checks whether the command is a single-word or double-word command
and extracts the necessary information, and ensures that invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

### Storage Component

The `Storage` class, under the `storage` package, is responsible for saving and loading the user's study plan to and
from a local file.

It provides methods to create the storage file if it does not exist, restore data from the file into the application's
study plan, and update the file when modules are added or deleted.

It also ensures that the data format is maintained correctly when reading from the file, 
and recreates the data file if it is found to be corrupted.

### Studyplan Component

`StudyPlan.java` is responsible for maintaining the study plan created by the user.

`StudyPlan` interacts with `ModuleHandler` class to create `Module` objects based on the Module Code.

`ModuleHandler` creates `Module` objects and populates the attributes using the `NUSModsFetcher` class.

`StudyPlan` adds `Module` objects to a 2D ArrayList<ArrayList<Module>>, where the first 'layer' is the respective
semester and the inner 'layer' is the respective modules taken in that semester.

`PrerequisiteChecker` interacts with `NUSModsFetcher` to read in Pre-Requisite data from the API to extract out the 
prerequisite tree and checks if they are met.

A hashmap is used to store KEY:VALUE pairs of MODULE_CODE:SEMESTER for easy access to edit the 2D ArrayList.
![StudyPlan class diagram](/UMLdiagrams/StudyPlanClass.png)

When a command is executed, it interacts with the `StudyPlan` component to modify or retrieve information about the

#### Design Considerations
We decided to use a 2D array together with a Hashmap to store the modules and semesters, as we believe that it offers
both structural clarity and efficiency when editing the study plan.

### UI component

This shows how the `Ui` class interacts with other components:
![UI sequence diagram](/UMLdiagrams/ViewCurrentSequence.png)

When a command is executed, it interacts with the `Ui` component to display messages to the user.

## Implementation

### **Parsing user input to Commands**

User inputs are parsed into commands by the **`Parser`** class.
![Parser class diagram](/UMLdiagrams/ParserClass.png)

* **Implementation:** A new parser object is instantiated in `ClassCraft.java` to handle user inputs,
  which calls the parser constructor in `Parser.java`, passing the raw user input string to parseInstructions().

* **Key Method: `parseInstructions(String userInput)`**
    * This method splits the user input into the command word and arguments.
    * It handles the instruction based on if it is a single word or a double word command.
    * The command word is extracted and saved to commandType variable.

* **Key Method: `parseInput()`**
    * This method uses a switch-case structure to map command words to their respective
      command classes (e.g., `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `ViewCommand`, etc).
    * It returns an instance of the appropriate command class based on the parsed command word.
    * If the command word does not match any known commands, it returns an `InvalidCommand` instance.

* **Helper Methods**
    * `parseAdd()`: Parses arguments for the `AddCommand`, extracting the module code and semester.
    * `parseDelete()`: Parses arguments for the `DeleteCommand`, extracting the module code.
    * `parseView()`: Parses arguments for the `ViewCommand`, determining whether to view the sample plan
      or graduation requirements.
    * `parseMC()` : Parses arguments for the `CalcCreditsCommand`, extracting the semester.
    * `parseSpec()` : Parses arguments for the `SpecCommand`, extracting the specialization.
    * `parsePrereq()` : Parses arguments for the `PrereqCommand`, extracting the module code.
    * `parseAddWithStatus()`: Parses arguments for the `AddCompletedCommand`, extracting the module code and status.
    * `parseCurrentSem()`: Parses arguments for the `SetCurrentSemesterCommand`, extracting the current semester.

#### Design Considerations

- **Alternative 1** (current choice) : Use a dedicated Parser class 
with methods like parseInstructions(), parseAdd(), etc.
  - *Pros:* Modular, extensible, clear separation of concerns.
  - *Cons:* Slightly more complex structure, with multiple methods.
- **Alternative 2** : Implement parsing logic directly within the main application class (ClassCraft).
  - *Pros:* Simpler structure, fewer classes.
  - *Cons:* Less modular, harder to maintain and extend as new commands are added.


### **Command Classes**

Each command class extends the abstract `Command` class.

* **Implementation:** Each command class is responsible for a specific user action, such as
  adding or deleting modules, viewing plans, calculating credits, etc.

* Command abstract class contains an abstract method `execute(StudyPlan studyPlan, Ui ui, Storage storage)` that each
  command class must implement to define its specific behavior.

* **Key Command Classes:**
    * `AddCommand`: Adds a module to a specified semester in the study plan.
    * `DeleteCommand`: Removes a module from the study plan.
    * `ViewCommand`: Displays either the sample study plan or graduation requirements.
    * `CalcCreditsCommand`: Calculates and displays the total modular credits for a specified semester.
    * `SpecCommand`: Displays specialization information that user can take if they have chosen a specialization.
    * `PrereqCommand`: Displays prerequisite information for a specified module.
    * `AddExemptedCommand`: Indicates module exemptions that the user has.
    * `CurrentSemCommand`: Sets the current semester the user is in (to determine completed modules and degree progress).
    * `InvalidCommand`: Handles unrecognized commands by displaying an error message.

* Below shows how the `AddCommand` class interacts with other components, with the AddCommand
calling the `addModule()` method in `StudyPlan` to add the module, and using `Ui` to display messages to the user.

![Add command sequence diagram](/UMLdiagrams/AddCommandSequence.png)

  
#### Design Considerations
- **Alternative 1** (current choice) : One class per command implementing an abstract execute(...) method. 
  - *Pros:* Easy to add new commands, adheres to the Command design pattern.
  - *Cons:* More classes to manage, slightly increased complexity.
- **Alternative 2** : Centralized command handler with large conditional blocks.
  - *Pros:* Fewer classes, simpler structure.
  - *Cons:* Harder to maintain and extend, violates single responsibility principle.

### **Fetching of Module Data from NUSMods API**

ClassCraft relies on the NUSMods API to determine module information, such as module credits, module titles, as well as 
prerequisites.

![NUSMods API Class Diagram](/UMLdiagrams/NUSModsFetcherClass.png))

* **Implementation:** The `NUSmodsFetcher.java` fetches data directly from the NUSMods API and returns each module as a JsonNode object. Each method returns a field of a specified module's `.json` file as a string, with the exception of getModuleCredits(moduleCode), which returns the field as an integer.
Each method first attempts to fetch the module `.json` file, and throws an `NUSmodsFetcher` exception if the creation of the JsonNode object fails (i.e. if the given module code is a module that does not exist in the API)

* **Key Methods:**
    * getModuleTitle(String moduleCode): Extracts the `"title"` field from the JsonNode and returns its value as a string
    * getModuleCredits(String moduleCode): Extracts the `"moduleCredit"` field from the JsonNode and returns its value as an integer
    * getDepartment(String moduleCode): Extracts the `"department"` field from the JsonNode and returns it as a string
    * getFaculty(String moduleCode): Extracts the `"faculty"` field from the JsonNode and returns it as a string
    * getModuleDescription(String moduleCode): Extracts the `"description"` field from the module JsonNode and returns it as a string
    * getPrerequisites(String moduleCode): Extracts the `"prerequisite"` field from the JsonNode and returns it as a string

* **Helper Methods:**
    * fetchModuleJson(moduleCode): Fetches the module data from the NUSMods API and reformats it into a JsonNode object
    * extractField(JsonNode root, String fieldName): Retrieves a specified field from the module JsonNode object

#### Design Considerations

Most of the key methods in `NUSmodsFetcher.java` return strings for ease of parsing within ClassCraft. The only exception, getModuleCredits(String moduleCode), returns an integer so that the value can be directly used for calculating workload.

As the programme only fetches data from one source (NUSMods API), `NUSmodsFetcher` never requires more than one instance, and is implemented as an abstract class, and all of its methods are static.

#### Disclaimer

Certain modules in the NUSMods API store their prerequisite data in a unique format. We have tested extensively for these exceptional cases and implemented fixes for those we have identified, but due to the size of the database, please be informed that few modules may not have their prerequisites correctly identified by ClassCraft.

### **Storing current Study Plan**

The current study plan created by the user is stored into a local ".txt" file.
file using the **`Storage`** class, and restored upon application launch.

* **Implementation:** The `Storage` class handles reading from and writing to the local file.
* **Key Methods: `createFile()`**
    * Creates a new file and its directory if it does not exist.
    * Called during application startup in the Storage constructor,
      when a new storage instance is created.
* **Key Methods: `restoreData(Storage storage)`**
    * Reads the stored study plan data from the local file.
    * Parses the data and reconstructs the `StudyPlan` object.
    * For each semester, it retrieves the list of module codes and uses
      the `StudyPlan`'s addModule method to populate the study plan.
* **Helper Methods**
    * `appendToFile(String moduleCode , int semester)`:
      Reads the stored plan and finds the semester to append the new module code to.
        * Used in studyPlan's `addModule()` method to update the storage file.
    * `deleteModule()`: Reads the stored plan and loops through each semester to find the
      specified module code and remove the specified module code.
        * Used in studyPlan's `deleteModule()` method to update the storage file.

#### Design Considerations
- **Alternative 1** (current choice) : Encapsulate file handling in a Storage class with methods
like createFile(), restoreData().
  - *Pros:* Promotes single responsibility, easier future upgrades.
  - *Cons:* Increased code complexity and performance overhead.
- **Alternative 2** : Direct file reads and writes scattered in application logic.
  - *Pros:* Simpler structure and less overhead.
  - *Cons:* Harder to maintain and error-prone.

### **Storing and Displaying Graduation Requirements**

The **`Grad`** class is responsible for holding the fixed, default CEG core modules.

* **Implementation:** The class uses a `private static final List<String> CEG_CORE_MODULES` to store the
  module codes. This list includes samples like "CS1010", "CS2030S", and "EE2026".
* **Key Method: `getAllRequirementsDisplay()`**
    * This method generates a formatted string for display.
    * It iterates through the `CEG_CORE_MODULES`.
    * For each module code, it uses a new instance of **`ModuleHandler`** to **`createModule()`**,
      which fetches details like the full module name and prerequisites. This design decouples the
      static list of required codes from the process of fetching dynamic details.

### **Generating the Sample Study Plan**

The **`StudyPlan`** class manages the user's study plan (a list of modules across semesters)
and includes a factory method to generate a pre-set sample plan.

* **Key Method: `createSampleStudyPlan()`**
    * This static method instantiates a new `StudyPlan` (assuming 8 semesters for the CEG course).
    * It uses the `StudyPlan`'s internal **`ModuleHandler`** to **`createModule()`** objects for
      sample modules (e.g., "CS1010", "MA1511", "CS2030S").
    * It then calls **`samplePlan.addModule(module, semester)`** to populate the plan for the
      initial semesters. For example, "CS1010" and "MA1511" are added to semester 1.
* **Design Rationale:** Generating the sample plan directly within the `StudyPlan` class via a
  factory method (`createSampleStudyPlan`) centralizes the knowledge of how a plan is structured and
  ensures that the sample plan is created using the same internal logic (`addModule`,
  `ModuleHandler`) as a user-generated plan.

### **Checking Module Pre-Requisites**

The **`PrerequisiteChecker`** class manages the data extracted from the NUSMods API and manages relevant pre-requisite tasks.

* **Implementation:** Extracts `PrereqTree` from the NUSMods API JsonNode and uses helper functions to clean up the data to be ready for display.

* **Key Methods:**
    * `validatePrerequisites((Module module, int targetSemester, StudyPlan studyPlan, boolean isRestore))`: Takes in a module and its semester and checks previous semesters for satisfaction of its pre-requisites.

* **Helper Methods**
    * `evaluatePrereqTree(JsonNode node, Set<String> completedModules)`:
      Recursively evaluates the prerequisite tree. Returns true if prerequisites are satisfied.
    * `evaluateNOfNode(JsonNode nOfNode, Set<String> completedModules)`
      Evaluate pre-requisites that require a certain number of modules from a list of modules.
    * `evaluateOrNode(JsonNode orNode, Set<String> completedModules)`
      Evaluate pre-requisites that require either modules.
    * `evaluateAndNode(JsonNode andNode, Set<String> completedModules)`
      Evaluate pre-requisites that require multiple modules all satisfied.
    * `countCompletedModules(JsonNode moduleList, Set<String> completedModules)`
      Returns the number of completed modules.
    * `isNodeCompleted(JsonNode mod, Set<String> completedModules)`
      Checks if the node is completed.
    * `isModuleCompleted(String moduleText, Set<String> completedModules)`
      Checks if the module is completed.
    * `isValidModuleCode(String moduleCode)`
      Checks if module code is valid.
    * `isBridgingModule(String moduleCode)`
      Checks if a module is a bridging module.
    * `prettifyPrereqTree(JsonNode node)`
      Formats the PrereqTree to make it ready for display to the user.
    * `prettifyLogicNode(JsonNode logicNode, String separator)`
      Formats the logic nodes to make it ready for display to the user.
    * `prettifyModuleCode(String moduleText)`
      Formats the module codes to make it ready for display to the user.

### **Checking Module Credits**

This feature allows the user to check either the number or module credits taken in a semester, or the module credits taken in the entire study plan.

* **Implementation:** Each `Module` object within the study plan has a modCreds attribute that stores the number of module credits it is worth. These values are retrieved from the NUSMods API by the `NUSmodsFetcher` class. The module credits taken, either in a semester or in the entire study plan, is calculated by simply summing up these values which are stored as integers.

* **Key Methods:**
    * `calculateSemCredits(int semesterIndex)`: Calculates the total number of module credits in a semester based on the semester's index in the ArrayList
    * `calculateTotalCredits()`: Calculates the total number of module credits taken in the entire study plan

### **Checking Workload Balance**

This feature allows the user to compare the workload between different semesters and receive a message if the workload is drastically unbalanced. The calculation ignores semesters that have already passed (i.e. semester number is less than the current semester indicated by the user).

* **Key Method:**
    * `checkStudyPlan()`: Compares the number of module credits between different semesters and prints a warning if any semester has more than 5 module credits excess of the average workload (remainin module credits divided by uncompleted semesters)

### **Viewing Degree Progress**

This feature allows the user to see their current academic progress toward graduation.
It displays a completion percentage along with the total "secured" Modular Credits (MCs) (from `COMPLETED` or `EXEMPTED`
modules) compared to the total MCs required.

* **Implementation:** The feature is initiated by the **`ViewProgressCommand`** class.
* This command class acts as a controller: it contains no business logic itself, but instead queries the **`StudyPlan`**
  class to get the progress data.
* The `StudyPlan` class is solely responsible for performing the calculations, as it owns the list of completed modules
  and the required MCs constant. Finally, the command formats this information and passes it to the **`Ui`** to be
  displayed to the user.

* **Key Methods: `ViewProgressCommand.executeCommand(StudyPlan studyPlan, Ui ui, Storage storage)`**
    * This is the main method invoked when the user runs the command.
    * It calls `studyPlan.getDegreeProgressPercentage()`, `studyPlan.getTotalSecuredMCs()`, and
      `studyPlan.getTotalMcsForGraduation()` to fetch the necessary data.
    * It formats these results into a user-readable `String` (e.g., "Your Degree Progress: 8.75%\nSecured MCs: 14 /
      160").
    * It passes this `String` to the `ui.showMessage()` method for display.

* **Key Methods: `StudyPlan.getDegreeProgressPercentage()`**
    * Calculates the degree progress percentage.
    * It gets the total secured MCs by calling `getTotalSecuredMCs()`.
    * It divides the secured MCs by the `TOTAL_MCS_FOR_GRADUATION` constant (e.g., 160) and multiplies by 100.0.
    * It rounds the result to two decimal places before returning.

* **Helper Methods: `StudyPlan.getTotalSecuredMCs()`**
    * Calculates the total number of MCs the student has "secured" (completed or exempted).
    * It iterates through the `completedModulesList` (which stores all modules marked as `COMPLETED` or `EXEMPTED`).
    * It sums the `modCreds` (Modular Credits) from each `Module` in that list and returns the total. `PLANNED` modules
      are not counted.

* **Helper Methods: `StudyPlan.getTotalMcsForGraduation()`**
    * This is a simple getter method.
    * It returns the value of the `TOTAL_MCS_FOR_GRADUATION` constant, allowing the `ViewProgressCommand` to access this
      value to display it to the user.

## Product scope

### Target user profile

The target user profile is **Computer Engineering (CEG) students at the NUS**, particularly those planning their module
enrolment across semesters and needing to
track their progress against graduation requirements. They are familiar with NUS module codes and the
concept of module prerequisites.

### Value proposition

ClassCraft solves the problem of manual and error-prone study planning. It provides a quick way for
CEG students to **visualize their academic journey**, ensure they meet the **default graduation
requirements**, and **check prerequisites** when adding or deleting modules, thus offering a
streamlined and guided approach to academic planning.

## Use cases

**Actors:** CEG Student (User)

**System** ClassCraft

**Use case: Add a Module to Study Plan**
1) User inputs the `add` command with module code and semester.
2) System validates the module code via NUSMods API.
3) System checks if the module already exists in the study plan.
4) If valid and not duplicate, System adds the module to the specified semester.
5) System confirms addition to the User.

**Use case: View Specialisation Requirements**
1) User inputs the `spec` command with the desired specialisation.
2) System retrieves the list of modules required for that specialisation from internal data.
3) System displays the list of modules to the User.


---
## Non-Functional Requirements

* **Reliability:** The application must correctly fetch and parse module data from the **NUSMods**
  API to ensure accurate prerequisites and module details.
* **Usability:** The command-line interface must be simple and intuitive, allowing students to
  perform core actions (view, add, delete) with minimal effort.
* **Performance:** The application should respond to basic commands (add, view, delete)
  instantaneously. Module data fetching should not result in long, noticeable delays.

## Instructions for manual testing

### Intial Setup and basic comamnds
1. **Start the application:** Compile and run the `ClassCraft` application.
2. **View Sample Plan:** Enter the command to view the sample study plan (e.g., `view sample`).
   Verify that the output shows modules like `CS1010` and `EE2026` across different semesters.
3. **View Graduation Requirements:** Enter the command to view the default graduation requirements
   (e.g., `view grad`). Verify that a list of core modules (e.g., `CS1010`, `CS2030S`, `EE2026`) is
   displayed along with their names and prerequisite information.
4. **Add a Module:** Enter a command to add a module (e.g., `add n/CS3230 s/5`). View the study plan
   again and confirm the module is placed in the specified semester.
5. **Delete a Module:** Enter a command to delete a module (e.g., `delete CS3230`). View the study
   plan and confirm the module is removed.


### Storage 

All data is stored in `ClassCraftData/studyPlan.txt` by default.

If the file or directory does not exist, it will be created automatically upon application startup.

If you wish to reset your study plan, you can delete the `studyPlan.txt` file.
 
If the file is edited manually, ensure that the format is maintained as
 
`{SEMESTER_NUMBER}:COMPLETED - {MODULE_CODE1}, {MODULE_CODE2}, ...`

(":COMPLETED" is only necessary if the modules in that semester have been completed)
 
`EXEMPTED - {MODULE_CODE1}:EXEMPTED, {MODULE_CODE2}:EXEMPTED, ...`
